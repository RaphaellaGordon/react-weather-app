# Weather app

## Objective
Find out weather conditions of any city using OpenWeatherMap API


## Demonstrable skills
React  
Asynchronous requests


## How to use
Typically you would need to sign up for free to receive an API key from OpenWeatherMap. However, I have left my key in App.js for ease of use.  
1. In the command line enter:   
$ **npm install**  
This will install all the packages needed to run this app
2. To run the app, in the command line enter:  
$ **npm start**  
This will start the app in your browser
